# Rock-Paper-Scissors in MIPS Assembly

Welcome to the only GitHub repository where you can find the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game coded in Assembly Language for the MIPS-32 architecture! This game is designed to be simulated on the Mars4_5 simulator, which is based on JAVA.

## Introduction

This project is an implementation of the Rock-Paper-Scissors game in MIPS Assembly language. It allows the user to play multiple rounds against the computer, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws. The computer's choices are generated randomly to ensure a fair game.

## Features

- User input for the number of rounds.
- Random computer choices for Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
- Tracks the number of wins, losses, and draws.
- Displays the final result after all rounds are played.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need the Mars4_5 simulator. You can download it from the following link:
[Mars4_5 Simulator](http://courses.missouristate.edu/KenVollmar/mars/download.htm)

### Running the Game

1. Open the Mars4_5 simulator.
2. Load the `rock_paper_scissors.asm` file into the simulator.
3. Assemble the program by clicking the "Assemble" button.
4. Run the program by clicking the "Run" button.
5. Follow the on-screen prompts to play the game.
